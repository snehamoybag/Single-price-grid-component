# Single-price-grid-component
This is my coding solution to the Single price grid component component challenge from frontendmentor.io

This challenge definitely helped me to practice my css layout skills using Grid and Flex-box.
I began codiding the mobile layout first then to shift the layout for desktop browsers I used grid inside a media query at 720px. And finally did a little bit of padding and font-size adjustment to the desktop layout to complete the project.
